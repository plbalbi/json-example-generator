Tool that generates random JSON examples, with a structure defined in a subset of GoLang struct syntax.

## Tooling
So far, the tooling that will be used is:
- GoYacc: https://about.sourcegraph.com/go/gophercon-2018-how-to-write-a-parser-in-go
- A build by hand Lexer, inspired in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxaD_trXwRE
